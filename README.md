# I'm Michael 👋

Senior Software Engineer with 18 years of experience building data-intensive applications across sports analytics, media, and fintech. I'm happiest when I'm hands-on with code, shipping products that solve real problems.

## What I'm building

🔍 **[MOTD Video Analyser](https://github.com/mbd0910/motd-video-analyser)** — Investigating potential bias in BBC football coverage using computer vision, NLP, and statistical analysis.
🛠️ **Client & side projects** — Currently building admin tools, business automation, and indie products using Next.js, TypeScript, and AI-assisted development workflows. Most of this work lives in private repos.

## Domain expertise

I spent a decade in sports analytics and algorithmic trading at Football Radar, building predictive models (Dixon-Coles, Monte Carlo simulations), exchange integrations (Betfair, Betdaq), and trading platforms. More recently I've worked on personalisation systems at The Guardian and ML-powered predictions at Moon Intelligence.

## Currently
